    <ul>
      <li>The correct OVA in Virtualbox is running and well-configured.</li>
      <li>
        The phone is connected to the WiFi of the router you configured, not the general WiFi. Note that Android
        can warn you that this WiFi has no Internet. This is correct and normal -just dismiss the message.
      </li>
      <li>
        Advanced: If Workbench is not in the default 192.168.2.2:5000, change the URL pressing the wrench above.
